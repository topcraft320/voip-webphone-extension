It allows you to make calls using your browser in an extremely productive way.

### TODO

* WebPack build

## Requirements

## Chrome Extension

Chrome Extension allows you to turn phone numbers and link with the extension to make calls quickly (Click-To-Call).  
This allows integration with any CRM. In the menu you also have an option to make the call. 

## Ready to use
You do not need to clone anything or install it on your server.  
I did a free version (hosted with https) that is used by the chrome extension.  
Please send me feedback if you will use. ;)

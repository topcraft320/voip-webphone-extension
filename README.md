It allows you to make calls using your browser in an extremely productive way.

## Chrome Extension

Chrome Extension allows you to turn phone numbers and link with the extension to make calls quickly (Click-To-Call).  
This allows integration with any CRM. In the menu you also have an option to make the call.

## Ready to use
I did a free version (hosted in github) that is used by the chrome extension (as popUP).  
If you improve this code, automatically it's reflected in the extension.  
Please send me feedback if you will use. ;)  

### Requirements
* Chrome / Firefox
